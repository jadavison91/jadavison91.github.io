<h2>Welcome to the Phantom Grid Sim Racing Project</h2>

    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the Phantom Grid Sim Racing Project! This started as a passion project for me to fuse the 
        excitement of sim racing with a software development project leveraging the creativity of AI. </p>
        
    <p>The goal of this project is to compete in full season championships with AI components and track the
        excitement of the season as it progresses. Each of the opponents as a full backstory, which can be read 
        on the website in the Driver Profiles area fpr their respective season. I plan to create new rosters for 
        each season that I create, focusing on different cars and classes. As the season progresses, rivalries will 
        emerge as everyone jockies for position at the top of the table. I will also be one of the drivers and will 
        include my own experiences in the race summaries. </p>
    
    <p>Using Generative AI and automation, each week's race results will be parsed from the iRacing logs and updated
        on the website. In addition to individual driver standings, a team championship will also be calculated. Drivers
        are placed in 2-man teams based on their car manufacturer. The driver profiles and team names were created 
        entirely by Generative AI, along with the driver profile pictures. 
    </p>
    <p>Check out the Tech Stuff pages to learn more about the engineering and software development process for managing
        all of the content. Since I will be racing alongside the AI opponents, I have also created a page on my sim
        racing rig, accessories, and setup.
