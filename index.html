<h2>Welcome to the Phantom Grid Sim Racing Project</h2>

<section>
    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the Phantom Grid Sim Racing Project! This started as a passion project for me to fuse the 
        excitement of sim racing with a software development project leveraging the creativity of AI. </p>
        
    <p>The goal of this project is to compete in full season championships with AI components and track the
        excitement of the season as it progresses. Each of the opponents as a full backstory, which can be read 
        on the website in the Driver Profiles area. As the season progresses, rivalries will emerge as everyone
        jockies for position at the top of the table. I will also be one of the drivers and will include my own
        experiences in the race summaries. </p>
    
    <p>Using Generative AI and automation, each week's race results will be parsed from the iRacing logs and updated
        on the website. In addition to individual driver standings, each team will consist of two drivers in the same
        car. The driver profiles and team names were created entirely by Generative AI, along with the driver profile
        pictures.
