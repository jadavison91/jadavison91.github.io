        <h1>Race Recap: Week 1<br>
		Canadian Tire Motorsports Park</h1>
        
        <h2>Opening Drama and Intense Battles</h2>
        <p>The inaugural race of the IMSA GT3 World Championship season at the storied Canadian Tire Motorsports Park unfolded with intense drama and thrilling battles. With 30 laps completed and three lead changes, the competitors left everything on the track, pushing their limits on the high-speed, technical corners of Mosport.</p>

        <h3>Practice & Qualifying Drama</h3>
        <p>The tone for the weekend was set early in the practice session. <span class="highlight">Jason Davison</span> dominated, setting a quick pace, though he had a few brushes with the limits, incurring five track incidents. <span class="highlight">Martin Ragginger</span> and <span class="highlight">Luca Stolz</span> followed closely, hinting at a potential showdown in the main event.</p>
        <p>Qualifying saw <span class="highlight">Kevin Estre</span> edge out Ragginger for pole position with a blistering lap, securing his place at the front. Davison, despite showing early promise, would start fourth after Estre, Ragginger, and <span class="highlight">Klaus Bachler</span> posted faster times.</p>

        <h3>The Race</h3>
        <p>As the race began, Estre and Ragginger quickly established themselves as the frontrunners, trading the lead in the opening laps with calculated moves and daring overtakes. Davison, starting fourth, stormed forward, capturing the lead by lap 3 and holding it tenaciously for an impressive 27 laps. But with just a few laps remaining, Estre made a brilliant comeback, capitalizing on a small miscalculation by Davison at the notorious Moss Corner.</p>
        <p>With Estre reclaiming the lead, Ragginger seized the opportunity to chase him down, finishing a tight 0.9 seconds behind. <span class="highlight">Julien Andlauer</span>, who had started fourth, steadily climbed through the ranks, showcasing consistent pace and skill to secure third place.</p>

        <h3>Final Standings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1. Kevin Estre (Car #911)</strong> - 200 Points</li>
            <li><strong>2. Martin Ragginger (Car #44)</strong> - 180 Points</li>
            <li><strong>3. Julien Andlauer (Car #6)</strong> - 160 Points</li>
            <li>4. Klaus Bachler (Car #33) - 140 Points</li>
            <li>5. Jason Davison (Car #66) - 120 Points</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Battles and Highlights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Davison’s Missed Opportunity:</strong> Leading much of the race, Davison’s minor mistake in Moss Corner cost him the top spot, a harsh reminder of the track’s unforgiving nature.</li>
            <li><strong>Late Surge by Andlauer:</strong> Known for endurance racing, Andlauer’s steady handling in the challenging corners secured his podium finish and valuable points.</li>
            <li><strong>Defensive Moves:</strong> Mirko Bortolotti charged up the field, facing challenges from <span class="highlight">Jack Aitken</span> and <span class="highlight">Yelmer Buurman</span>. Buurman held his position, finishing seventh.</li>
            <li><strong>Kirchhofer vs. Gamble:</strong> Teammates and rivals, <span class="highlight">Marvin Kirchhofer</span> and <span class="highlight">Tom Gamble</span> fought a fierce duel, with Kirchhofer finishing eighth and Gamble struggling with tire wear to 12th.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight">Kevin Estre</span>’s victory at Mosport puts him in early contention for the championship, while <span class="highlight">Martin Ragginger</span>’s strong showing suggests he’s not far behind. Jason Davison’s near-win will fuel his drive in upcoming races, and Andlauer’s podium shows he’s a steady competitor. Fans can expect fierce rivalries and surprises as the season continues toward the next race in Braselton, Georgia, at Road Atlanta.</p>
