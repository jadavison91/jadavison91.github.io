        <h3>Qualifying Drama Sets the Tone</h3>
        <p>Jason Davison (#66) stormed to pole position with an impressive lap of 1:17.27, edging out Thierry Bernard (#911) by a fraction of a second. Bernard’s close second-place qualifying time, just 0.13 seconds behind, set up an intense showdown, with Lukas Huber (#44) and Tobias Steiner (#33) securing third and fourth positions. Davison’s pole hinted at a strong showing, but as the race unfolded, the battle for victory proved anything but predictable.</p>
        
        <h3>Race Recap: Bernard’s Resilience Pays Off</h3>

        <p>Meanwhile, Huber and Pascal Lefevre (#6) put on a fantastic show of grit, fighting through the middle pack to claim second and third places, respectively. Their duel intensified on lap 27, with Huber defending his position aggressively through Moss Corner. Lefevre managed to slip by on the Andretti Straight but couldn’t close the gap to Bernard before the checkered flag.</p><p><strong><em>“I gave it everything through those last few laps,' Lefevre shared. “Thierry [Bernard] was just untouchable today.”</em></strong></p>
